In mathematics the Vicsek fractal, also known as Vicsek snowflake or box fractal,[1][2] is a fractal arising from a construction similar to that of the Sierpinski carpet, proposed by Tamás Vicsek. It has applications including as compact antennas, particularly in cellular phones.


Variant[3]

6 steps of a Sierpinski carpet

Self-affine fractal built from a 3 × 2 grid
Box fractal also refers to various iterated fractals created by a square or rectangular grid with various boxes removed or absent and, at each iteration, those present and/or those absent have the previous image scaled down and drawn within them. The Sierpinski triangle may be approximated by a 2 × 2 box fractal with one corner removed. 
The Sierpinski carpet is a 3 × 3 box fractal with the middle square removed.
